# MushroomPocket
This is a C# school project that im working on, which covers OOP and Entity Framework

This console application let Super Marioâ€™s players keep, view the characters they played and check if they can transform to a higher role character to protect the Mushroom Kingdom. If the characters in the pocket are ready to transform, the player can transform their characters. Each time the player played a character, they can add the character details to their Mushroom Pocket.

## How to use MushroomPocket
(1). Add a character to your pocket

(2). List character(s) in your pocket

(3). Check if you can transform your characters

(4). Transform all your eligible characters

(5). Remove a character from your pocket

(6). Battle against the PC!

## Notes
- You can only add the 3 base characters (Daisy, Wario, and Waluigi) to your pocket, which can be transformed if you meet the requirements
- You need 2 Daisy's to transform into Peach, 3 Warios to transform into Mario and only 1 Waluigi to transform into Luigi
- All characters' health will be temporarily set to 100 for battle. This won't affect the original health of your characters.
- You can use transformations in Battle Mode
- You only have 2 dodges against the opposing character's attack
- The character that remains with the most HP after all 3 battle rounds wins the battle!
- If your character and the opposing character has the same HP after all 3 battle rounds, the battle will be a draw
